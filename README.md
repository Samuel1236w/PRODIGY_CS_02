OVERVIEW   
This is a Python-based tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using a simple key-based method. The tool manipulates the pixel values of the image to encrypt it, ensuring that only users with the correct key can decrypt and restore the original image.

FEATURES 

   	•	Image Encryption: Modify pixel values of an image to produce an encrypted, scrambled version.
	•	Image Decryption: Reverse the modifications to restore the original image using the same encryption key.
	•	Key-Based Security: Ensures that only users with the correct key can decrypt the image.
